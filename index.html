            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>As an international student from Taiwan currently pursuing my studies at the University of California, Santa Cruz, 
                I am enthusiastically seeking opportunities to apply my passion for technology and problem-solving in a professional setting through an internship. 
                My academic journey has allowed me to delve deeply into the realms of Java and Python 3, while also expanding my programming toolkit by learning C and C++ through my coursework. 
                I thrive on tackling complex challenges, which is why I regularly participate in LeetCode contests, honing my coding skills and analytical thinking. 
                Outside the digital world, I find joy and excitement in skiing, embracing challenges of a different nature. 
                I am open to both paid and unpaid internship opportunities, eager to contribute my skills and learn from real-world experiences in the tech industry.</p>
